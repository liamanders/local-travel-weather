# Week 3 Progress

# Overview
### This week, we continued our focus on integrating the backend API with the frontend. Our primary goal was to establish a seamless connection between the two, ensuring smooth data flow and user experience.

# Key Accomplishments
## API Integration:

#### Backend:
- Further refined the API endpoints to provide the necessary data for the frontend.
- Implemented robust error handling.
#### Frontend:
- Successfully fetched data from the API using appropriate techniques fetch, Axios and Cors.
- Implemented logic to handle API responses, including error handling and data parsing.

## Frontend:
- Broke down the frontend into smaller, reusable components.
- Organized components into a clear and maintainable structure.
- Implemented a loading state indicator to provide visual feedback during API requests.

# Challenges
#### API Response Handling:
- We encountered some challenges in handling API responses.

#### Component Communication:
- Efficiently communicating data between components, especially across multiple levels, requires careful planning.
- Implementing a mechanism to initiate backend requests only when the user provides input in the field.
