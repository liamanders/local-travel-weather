# Group Project - Week 2: Initial Development and Documentation Review

## Summary
In Week 2, we moved from planning into the initial development phase. This week involved setting up our individual tasks, establishing the project structure, and diving into API documentation. Here’s an overview of our progress and key learnings:

## Key Activities

### 1. Project Skeleton and Branch Setup
We completed the project skeleton, establishing a foundation that each of us could build upon. Individual branches were created to manage our tasks independently and streamline integration.

### 2. API Documentation Review
A critical part of the week involved going through API documentation to understand the data and endpoints required for our components. This helped us outline specific calls and set expectations for integration later on.

### 3. Regular Sync Meetings
We scheduled follow-up meetings on **Tuesday** and **Friday** to check in on progress, address initial questions, and ensure alignment on project requirements. These check-ins allowed us to troubleshoot and share insights across tasks.

## Challenges

### 1. Using the Trafikverket API
We encountered some challenges working with the Trafikverket API, specifically with handling the documentation and understanding response structures. To overcome these hurdles, we explored alternative methods and shared findings within the team to ensure each component functioned as intended.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Importance of Initial Structure
Setting up a clear project skeleton and individual branches from the start was essential. This structure streamlined our development, ensuring each person’s work aligned with the overall project.

### 2. Documentation Review as a Team
Reviewing the documentation together helped us to learn how it works, and clarify API requirements.

### 3. Effective Communication Early On
Having regular sync meetings early in the project provided a foundation for ongoing collaboration, making it easier to tackle issues as they arose.

Overall, Week 2 was foundational in setting up the project, diving into API requirements, and fostering an environment of consistent communication. These efforts prepared us for the weeks ahead, with a strong foundation for our individual tasks and future integration.
